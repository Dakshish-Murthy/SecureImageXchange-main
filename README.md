# Image Encryption and Decryption Web Application

A web-based tool to securely encrypt and decrypt image files using cryptographic algorithms. Protect sensitive images by encrypting them and retrieve them back with the decryption feature.

---

## Features

- *Image Encryption*: Encrypt uploaded image files with a cryptographic algorithm to secure them.
- *Image Decryption*: Decrypt the previously encrypted image to retrieve the original.
- *User-Friendly Web Interface*: Easy-to-use interface for seamless interaction.

## Usage

1. *Encryption*:
   - Upload an image file via the interface.
   - Select an encryption algorithm (currently supports DES).
   - Generate the encrypted file with one click.

2. *Decryption*:
   - Upload the encrypted image.
   - Use the same encryption algorithm details for decryption.
   - Retrieve the original image.

## Supported Algorithms

- *DES* (Data Encryption Standard): Symmetric key encryption for securing images.  
  Note: Additional algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA) will be added in future updates.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add support for multiple algorithms like AES, RSA.
- [ ] Improve interface for enhanced user experience.
- [ ] Introduce encryption key management.
- [ ] Add authentication for better security.
